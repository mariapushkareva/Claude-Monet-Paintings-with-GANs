# Claude-Monet-Paintings-with-GANs
Generative adversarial networks (GANs), introduced in 2014 by Goodfellow, are for learning latent spaces of images. They enable the generation of fairly realistic synthetic images by forcing the generated images to be statistically almost indistinguishable from real ones
*  *Generator network* —Takes as input a random vector (a random point in the latent space), and decodes it into a synthetic image
*  *Discriminator network (or adversary)* —Takes as input an image (real or synthetic), and predicts whether the image came from the training set or was created by the generator network
## Objective: Build a GAN that generates 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images using TensorFlow
